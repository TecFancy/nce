# Lesson 1 A private conversation

#### First listen and then answer the question.

*Why did the writer complain to the people behind him?*

Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a yound woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. 'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.

'It's none of your business,' the yound man said rudely. 'This is a private conversation!'
